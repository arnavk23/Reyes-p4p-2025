Figures and Code Snippets
------------------------

Below are some key code snippets and example figures generated during the program. These illustrate the practical application of Python to physics problems and data analysis.

Figure 1: Plotting Mathematical Functions
-----------------------------------------
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
x = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
def f1(x): return np.power(x, 1.5)
def f2(x): return np.power(x, 2)
plt.plot(x, f1(x), label='x^1.5')
plt.plot(x, f2(x), label='x^2')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Function Comparison')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.show()
```
*This plot compares two mathematical functions, showing their different growth rates.*

Figure 2: Monte Carlo Estimation of Pi
--------------------------------------
```python
def randpm(count):
    x = np.random.random(count) * 2.0 - 1.0
    return x
def calcpi(Nt):
    x0, y0 = np.random.random(Nt), np.random.random(Nt)
    x = x0 * 2.0 - 1.0
    y = y0 * 2.0 - 1.0
    r = np.sqrt(np.power(x, 2) + np.power(y, 2))
    xin = x[r < 1]
    pi_ran = 4.0 * len(xin) / float(Nt)
    return pi_ran
print(f"Estimated pi: {calcpi(10000)}")
```
*This code uses random sampling to estimate the value of π (pi) using the Monte Carlo method.*

Figure 3: Gaussian Distribution and Histogram
--------------------------------------------
```python
m0, dm0 = 1, 0.01
Npoints = 1000
m0s = np.random.normal(m0, dm0, Npoints)
plt.hist(m0s, bins=25)
plt.title('Gaussian Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Value')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```
*This histogram visualizes a set of values drawn from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.*

Figure 4: Projectile Motion Simulation
-------------------------------------
```python
import math
def draw_trajectory(v0):
    g = 9.8
    delx = 1
    dely = 4
    x = np.arange(0.0, delx, .01)
    theta = math.radians(45)
    y = math.tan(theta) * x - 0.5 * g * x ** 2 / (v0 ** 2 * math.cos(theta) ** 2)
    plt.plot(x, y)
    plt.xlabel('x-position')

Reflections and Insights
------------------------
The program’s structure, combining lectures, coding exercises, and guest presentations, provided a holistic learning environment. I particularly enjoyed the hands-on projects, which made abstract concepts tangible. The guest lectures offered valuable perspectives on real-world research and the application of computational methods in physics.

Throughout the program, I found the collaborative environment and the diversity of projects especially rewarding. Working alongside peers with different backgrounds allowed me to see multiple approaches to problem-solving. I appreciated the opportunity to present my work and receive feedback, which helped me refine both my coding and communication skills.

One guest lecture that stood out was the session on computational astrophysics, where we saw how Python is used to model complex systems in research. This inspired me to think about how I might apply these techniques in my own studies, particularly in areas like data analysis and simulation.

Expanded Reflections and Personal Insights
-----------------------------------------
Participating in Python4Physics 2025 was not only an academic experience but also a personal journey of growth. The daily structure, which combined lectures, hands-on coding, and collaborative projects, fostered a supportive and motivating environment. I found that learning alongside peers with diverse backgrounds encouraged me to approach problems from new perspectives and to communicate my ideas more clearly.

One of the most impactful aspects of the program was the opportunity to engage with guest lecturers who are active researchers in their fields. The session on computational astrophysics, for example, demonstrated how the concepts we practiced in class are applied to real-world scientific questions. This inspired me to consider how I might use computational tools in my own future research, whether in physics, engineering, or data science.

The capstone project in the final days of the program was a highlight. Working in a team, we tackled a complex problem that required integrating skills from across the curriculum: data analysis, simulation, visualization, and scientific communication. Presenting our results to the group was both challenging and rewarding, and the feedback we received helped me see the value of clear, reproducible code and effective storytelling with data.

Looking back, I am grateful for the challenges I encountered—especially those that initially seemed daunting, such as debugging code or interpreting unexpected results. These moments taught me resilience and the importance of seeking help and collaborating with others. I now feel equipped not only with technical skills but also with the confidence to tackle new problems and to continue learning independently.

Future Applications
-------------------
I plan to use the skills gained in Python4Physics in my future coursework and research. Whether analyzing experimental data, simulating physical systems, or visualizing results, I now feel confident in my ability to use Python as a powerful tool for scientific inquiry. I am also motivated to continue learning about advanced topics such as machine learning and computational modeling.

Final Thoughts
--------------
Python4Physics 2025 has been a transformative experience. I am excited to apply the skills and insights I have gained to future academic projects, internships, and research opportunities. I am also motivated to continue exploring advanced topics in computational science, such as machine learning, numerical methods, and scientific visualization. I would like to thank the instructors, guest speakers, and my fellow participants for their support, encouragement, and inspiration throughout this journey.
